# Hijacr Is Just Another Comic Reader

## What?
Hijacr is an open-source webcomic reader for Android.

## Why?
People like reading webcomics during breakfast or while sitting on a train to work. Unfortunately some webcomics' websites do not handle mobile devices very well which makes navigation and viewing comics complicated. Hijacr's goal is to provide a pain-free webcomic experience.

## When?
The project is still very young and a release date cannot be specified.

# Hijacr Is Just Another Comic Reader
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EightBitBoy/hijacr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EightBitBoy/hijacr) [![Dependency Status](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/56141eeaa193340019000551/badge.svg?style=flat)](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/56141eeaa193340019000551)

## What?
Hijacr is an open-source webcomic reader for Android. It supports some geeky webcomics out-of-the-box.

## Why?
People like reading webcomics during breakfast or while sitting on a train to work. Unfortunately some webcomics' websites do not handle mobile devices very well which makes navigation and viewing comics complicated. Hijacr's goal is to provide a pain-free webcomic experience.

## When?
The project is still very young and a release date cannot be specified.

## Does Hijacr need contributors?
Sure! Every line of code is welcome! There are a lot of things to do:
- Software tests
- Application tests on other devices
- Save user data
- Make everything configurable
- Create a new app icon
- Integrate more comics
- Handle crash reports

Have a look at the [TODO file](https://github.com/EightBitBoy/hijacr/blob/master/TODO.md)!
